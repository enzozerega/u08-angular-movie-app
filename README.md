# My watching list app

This app was developed as part of my training as a web developer at Chas Academy using Angular 
<img src="./src/assets/img/logo.png" alt="Angular" width="30"/><br>
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.3.

The app allows the user to:
- Search movies by title and actors by name
- Click on a result to see more details
- Scroll through a list of current popular movies
- Add movies to a watching list (data is stored in local storage)
